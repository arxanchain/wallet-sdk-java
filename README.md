## Wallet-Sdk-Java
Blockchain Wallet SDK includes APIs for managing wallet accounts(Decentralized Identifiers, DID), digital assets(Proof of Existence, POE), colored tokens etc.

You need not care about how the backend blockchain runs or the unintelligible techniques, such as consensus, endorsement and decentralization. Simply use the SDK we provide to implement your business logics, we will handle the caching, tagging, compressing, encrypting and high availability.
